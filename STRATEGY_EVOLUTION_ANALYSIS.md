**Keep what works, make it safer:**
- Use new risk controls (5% position, 10% stop-loss)
- Focus on higher-quality meme coins (>$100K liquidity)
- Target established meme coins with volume > $50K/day
- Use enhanced backtesting to optimize entry/exit

### Tier 2: **Major Altcoin Momentum** (30% allocation)
